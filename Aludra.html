			<h1>Process</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="contentText">
			<p>Aludra is based on the use of the broad nib pen. During the process, mainly through calligraphy, I tried to find the right rhythm and feel of the font. In addition, the variable font aspect came into play. The main thing I took from this is that a variable font can be useful mainly as a tool but not always as an end product. The variable font technology holds you to different rules that can sometimes get in the way of the freedom of certain shapes. Nevertheless, this was a tremendously fun and educational project to work on. </p>
