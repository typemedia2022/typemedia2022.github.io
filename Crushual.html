			<p>Crushual is a bi-script Latin-Thai typeface intended for exploring the possibility between Thai and Latin. Both Latin and Thai were drawn simultaneously, attempting to share the same visual language in design, texture, and typographic usage while not appearing peculiar to their native readers. The initial plan was to research and develop the Thai loop constraint and its Latin counterpart. <br><br>

The low-contrast condensed black display explores the limitation between the Thai loop restrictions and Latin serif construction; based on this style, the body text and the italics followed. <br><br>

Notably, most Thai typefaces use slanted Thai instead of cursive construction. Is it not commonly used because it is not the norm? Thus, I used this typeface to experiment with a Thai cursive construction. Thai’s italic is based on fast handwriting rather than elegant calligraphy to reduce the text’s formality and create the distinction between roman and italic. The broken lines and crisp design were also applied to Latin.<br><br>

Crushual has a long way to go in terms of expanding its weight and width. This is only the beginning of the family’s journey.

			<h1>Process</h1>
		</div>

		<div class="contentText">
			<p>Crushual typeface aims to explore the possibility between Thai and Latin. I was pursuing questioning of “Is it possible to…” one after another. This project’s design development could be seen as a “Testing Water” along the process. <br><br>

The first question raised in search of the display idea: “Is it possible to design a playful Latin-Thai typeface that works nicely in both scripts?”. Not so long after playing around with the brush-reversed contrast. I found the design which I like and could derive into many weights (see sketches on the diagram under February). <br><br>

My second question was, “Is it possible to make it condensed?”, I tried to make it condensed in both scripts with and without applying the contrast. In the meantime, I also asked my third question, “Is it possible to design Thai along with Latin in the script style?” Thai originally is not commonly found to be connected, so it came out in the disconnected scripts in March. <br><br>

Then “Is it possible to make a type family for display, text, and italic?” For Latin, it is out of the question. If I keep Thai as it is in high contrast for the display, I can see that it will not be a problem. However, in low-contrast for body text, especially in Thai, it raised the question of what kind of loop or how small it can be in bolder weight. Then I did some small sketches to explore the different thicknesses, sizes, and the design of the loop counter style. I came to a conclusion, which is not so surprising, that the bolder weight in the Thai loop has to have some limits, and to go into the realm of black weight, I have to make it for the display, then it can go darker while maintaining the point size to not be lower than 30 pt. With that idea of making it darker, I pushed the design to be the display. I also want to add another challenge to myself in the Latin counterpart by doing it in slab-serif. Thai with a loop has a lot of “spacing” challenges since it cannot be as nicely condensed as Latin can be. So the Latin in Crushual shows a lot of compromising by adding more room in this condensed width. On the contrary, the design for body text was given a bit of a higher contrast to make room for bolder weight and maintain the legibility of Thai looped in small size.<br><br>

The italic is the last exploration in this paragraph; the italic in Thai is not commonly used. True italic is usually appearing in the temple or religious ceremony. Therefore, making true italic in this typeface could change the voice of this typeface from “casual” to “formal.” So one way of my exploration, instead of using slanted Thai, I apply the idea of fast handwriting to Thai and Latin. I still keep the Thai upright for now to see how it will be used, and who knows if the upright Thai italic today can become playful true italic in the future.<br><br>

Overall, it was just my visual exploration. I would say it is more toward “hypothesis” more than conducting any research. My bi-script visual study on this topic is still a long way to go, I truly believe this is just the beginning.
